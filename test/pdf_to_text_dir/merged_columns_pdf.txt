most of which focus either on the first year of life or on
adolescence, have used techniques including direct behav-
ioral observations,1,2 laboratory studies,3-8 video record-
ings,9 and mattress or crib recordings.10-11 The strengths
and weaknesses of these techniques vary,12 but none has the
capacity for true objective ambulatory monitoring over
extended periods. More recently, methods employing con-
tinuous measurement of activity by monitors with solid-
state memory (actigraphs) have facilitated the assessment
of naturalistic sleep/wake patterns. Actigraph monitors

have evolved into small, lightweight, and unobtrusive
devices capable of collecting time-based activity data over
extended periods. In conjunction with validated algorithms
for transforming activity data to sleep/wake estimates, this
technology provides an opportunity for systematic docu-
mentation of natural sleep/wake behavior of infants, chil-
dren, and adolescents.13
Current actigraph methodology, however, is not with-
out shortcomings. For example, although leading propo-
nents of sleep/wake assessment with actigraphy have cau-
tioned that measurement characteristics vary in combina-
tion with type of device, type of algorithm, and type of par-
ticipant,14 relatively few studies have reported on the valid-
ity and reliability of actigraphic sleep/wake measures. We
have demonstrated previously that the Mini Motionlogger
actigraph and its associated sleep/wake scoring algo-
rithms15-16 provide valid measures of behavioral sleep/wake
patterns for normal infants, children, and adults within
documented nocturnal periods. The scoring algorithms are
relatively insensitive to placement on the participant (eg,
dominant vs nondominant wrist) and to sensitivity differ-
ences between individual devices.15 Validity, however, is
assessed in structured situations, such as during laboratory-
based sleep studies where the kinds of difficulties faced in
field-based ambulatory recording are not encountered. For
example, laboratory bedtime, risetime, and total recording
time are determined and documented by protocol, technical
problems and artifacts are either resolved quickly or docu-
mented thoroughly, and participants who are sleep-
deprived, ill, or use medications, caffeine, or nicotine are
typically excluded. Even so, aggregation of data over mul-
tiple nights is routinely done for sleep measures obtained in
the laboratory because of known or suspected instability of
single-night measures,17-20 particularly apparent during the
first laboratory night.21 Indeed, some older studies report
data aggregated over as many as 4 and 5 nights22 with the
assumption that averaging values over multiple nights will
ensure reproducible individual differences.
In classical test theory, observed score variance on a
test is assumed to be the sum of true score variance and ran-
dom error variance (with reliability defined as the ratio of
true score variance to total variance). Furthermore, if a test
is made longer by combining or aggregating parallel ver-
sions of it (ie, versions consisting of correlated items), the
proportion of true-score variance will increase as the
summed error variance approaches its expected value of
zero.* Thus, lengthening a test with parallel forms should
improve the accuracy of measurement if the true scores are
not subject to systematic fluctuation across situations (eg,
practice, developmental, psychosocial, or environmental

*Item here is used to refer to a single-night measurement.
effects). Aggregation of measures over multiple items is
thus used to stabilize individual (true-score) differences,
yielding measures that not only typify the individual but
may also be expected to predict other variables. The best
index of whether such aggregation is indeed useful is the
reliability estimate of a single measurement item (ie, for 1
night of sleep) compared with the reliability of scores
obtained by aggregating over multiple measurement items
(ie, for multiple nights of sleep).
By its nature, actigraphic assessment of sleep/wake
patterns outside the laboratory loses control over the myri-
ad of factors that we know can impact on the stability of
sleep measures. Few studies, however, have addressed reli-
ability of measures and, by extension, the number of
recording nights required to obtain aggregated measures
that both characterize individuals and have predictive
validity.13,14,16,23,24 If actigraphic sleep/wake estimates are
to be useful as accurate measures of individual differences,
then we must know how many nights to record.
The purpose of this study was to estimate the reliabili-
ty of aggregate values based on 1 to 7 nights of recording
for five commonly used actigraphic measures of sleep pat-
terns. We also assessed reliability as a function of type of
night (weeknight or weekend night). Finally, we assessed
the stability of aggregated measures over 2 months for a
subset of participants. Such evaluations are critical to
assure the most appropriate and efficient use of actigraphy
for the study of sleep patterns.
METHODS
Data for this report were drawn from three studies that
obtained at least 7 nights of actigraph data on children and
adolescents living at home on self- or parent-selected sleep-
wake schedules.25-28 All procedures were approved by the
E.P. Bradley Hospital Institutional Review Board for the
Protection of Human Subjects (IRB), and parents provided
informed consent for participants. A brief description of
each study is provided below.
Study 1: Infant/Childhood Activity Study (child
groups).—Boys and girls aged 12-60 months took part in a
project aimed at describing normative behavioral sleep-
wake patterns.25,26 Potential participants were located from
a variety of sources, screened, and recruited into groups of
12-, 18-, 24-, 30-, 36-, 48-, and 60-month-olds (with 2-
month windows around each age). Successful completion
of the study required at least 4 nights of actigraph data
when (1) the child was not sick or taking medications; (2)
the actigraph was on the child and collecting data; (3) the
data corresponded to the mother’s diary; and (4) the diary
was completed appropriately. Of the 169 children (84 boys
and 85 girls) who completed the study, 154 were
Caucasian, 3 African-American, 1 Asian, 1 Hispanic, and
10 of mixed racial descent. Fifty additional participants

Stability of actigraphy—Acebo et al 
aged 12-60 months were enrolled but dropped from the
study for a variety of reasons, including illness (n=20),
child’s refusal to wear actigraph (n=11), technical problems
(n=10), mother’s lack of compliance with procedures
(n=3), and discovery of exclusion criteria (see below) after
assessments were complete (n=6). Data from 15 partici-
pants came from a second or third week of recording due to
technical problems or illness during the first week.
Inclusion criteria were that children were full-term
infants with no medical complications at birth, lived full-
time with their biological mothers, and had mothers who
could read and write English. Children were excluded for
major genetic, medical, psychological/behavioral prob-
lems, or serious sleep problems (defined by parent). Also
excluded were children whose parents reported mental
health problems or sleep disorders in the child’s first-
degree relatives, and children who were taking medications
that might affect sleep or alertness. Because the actigraph
records motion, children who routinely co-slept with par-
ents or siblings were not included in the study, although
some periods of co-sleeping did occur and were document-
ed by parents.
Participants who passed a telephone screening inter-
view were scheduled for a home visit. At this time, moth-
ers were interviewed to obtain demographic and health
information, the actigraph was put on the child and the
mother was instructed in its care and use, instructions were
provided for diary completion, and a booklet of additional
questionnaires was left for parents to complete during the
week. This project used Mini Motionlogger actigraphs
(Advanced Model, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley,
NY), weighing 57 g, set for 1-minute recording bins and
zero crossing mode (a measure of movement frequency).
The device accumulates one count each time movement
causes the sensor signal to cross a fixed reference signal.
Amplifier setting 18 was used for this device, which yields
a sensitivity of .05 g in a frequency range 2 to 3 Hz. Parents
of children under 36 months of age placed the actigraph on
the child’s left ankle; for children 36 months or older, the
actigraph was placed on the nondominant wrist (as report-
ed by parents). Mothers kept a diary of the child’s bedtimes
and risetimes, as well as times when the actigraph was off
or exposed to external motion (such as car rides). Research
staff telephoned mothers in the middle of the week to ask
about any problems, illnesses, or special events, and to
remind them about the second home visit. The second
home visit was made at the end of the week to check the
dairy and questionnaires for completeness and to collect
the actigraph and forms. The actigraph was downloaded
into the computer immediately upon return to the laborato-
ry, the record was printed and checked against the mother's
diary, and a follow-up phone call was made to resolve any
discrepancies or to ask about missing data.

Study 2: Circadian Rhythms Project (adolescent
group A).—Adolescent Group A included 19 participants
(10 boys, ages 11.2 to 14. 1, mean 12.7±1.0 years; 9 girls
ages 12.2 to 14.4, mean 13.1±0.7) participating in a study
investigating sleep and circadian rhythm parameters with
home and laboratory assessments.27  Participants were
recruited through a laboratory open house for parents and
children at which procedures were explained and demon-
strated. Exclusion criteria included self-reported sleep
schedules that varied by greater than 3 hours across a week
or that indicated a pattern of chronic insufficient sleep; cur-
rent sleep problem or sleep disorder in self or parent; major
genetic, medical, psychological or behavioral problems;
mental retardation or learning disabilities; current use of
psychoactive agents or other drugs that may affect sleep
and alertness; or reported family history (first-degree rela-
tive) of diagnosed major depressive disorder, bipolar
depression, or schizoaffective disorder. Screening was per-
formed by interview, questionnaire, and child and parental
report. Eighteen of the group A adolescents were Caucasian
and one was of mixed African-American/Native-American
descent.
For one phase of this study, participants wore wrist
actigraphs identical to those described above on the non-
dominant wrist29 for 7 days while living at home on their
self-selected sleep-wake schedules. No participants had
summer school or similar obligations during this week. In
addition to wearing the actigraph, participants completed
daily diaries and called the laboratory each morning to
report bedtime, risetime, and whether the actigraph was
working. Follow-up telephone calls were made by research
staff to all participants at midweek and whenever a partici-
pant failed to make a morning call to the lab. The only con-
straints on these youngsters’ sleep patterns were that they
were to sleep at home each night and to avoid staying
awake all night. Participants came to the lab at the end of
the week, at which time the actigraph was downloaded, the
actigraph record was printed, and discrepancies between
record and diary were resolved before subjects left the lab-
oratory or by phone call the next day.
Study 3: School Transition Project (adolescent
group B).—The third group were adolescents taking part
in a longitudinal study investigating sleep/wake pattern
changes across the 9th to 10th grade transition.28 These par-
ticipants were recruited from Rhode Island junior high
schools, and we have included data from 36 (13 boys, ages
14.0 to 15.7, mean 14.9±.4 years; 23 girls ages 14.4 to 16.2,
mean 15.0±.5) who completed the summer and/or fall ses-
sions. These data allow comparisons of sleep parameters
from actigraphy between times with and without school
schedules. Thirty adolescents were Caucasian, two were
African-American, two were Hispanic, one was Bermudan,
and one was of mixed ethnicity. Data from both sessions

were available for 29 of the 36 participants. Actigraph data
were not available for two participants during the fall ses-
sion because of technical problems in one and because the
other withdrew from the study. Data are unavailable for
five participants during the summer assessment due to
technical problems for two, and as a result of irreconcilable
differences between actigraph record and diary report for
three. Exclusion criteria included parent- or child-reported
current sleep disorder, chronic medical illness, use of psy-
choactive drugs, or evidence of learning disabilities/psy-
chopathology.
Procedures for this group were the same as for
Adolescent group A described above. Data were taken from
the first 7 nights of the summer and fall studies when par-
ticipants lived at home on self-selected sleep-wake sched-
ules, wore actigraphs on nondominant wrists, completed

Measures
Sleep/wake measures were estimated from actigraphic
data using the validated ASA algorithm.15,16 Each nightly
record was scored for the portion indicated as nighttime
sleep by parent (children 12-60 months) or adolescent
(group A, group B) report. Specifically, the algorithm was
applied during portions of the record encompassing 30
minutes before reported bedtime through 30 minutes after
reported rising time (the scoring interval). The variables
assessed for this report are defined below and illustrated in
Fig. 1. All final scoring required reasonable correspon-

diary bedtime of 2300 but continuous sleep could be scored
beginning at 2130, the adolescent was questioned about the
discrepancy. If no reasonable explanation was offered, the
night was considered unscorable.
Sleep start time: the first minute of at least 3 consecu-
tive minutes of sleep as scored by the ASA algorithm
Sleep end time: the last minute of at least 5 consecutive
minutes of sleep just prior to the end of the scoring
interval as scored by the ASA algorithm (This variable
was not analyzed for this report.)
Sleep period: elapsed minutes from sleep start time to
sleep end time
Sleep minutes: minutes of sleep period that are scored
as sleep by the ASA algorithm (indicated by an open bar
on the ASA score bar in Fig. 1)
Wake minutes: the number of minutes awake during
sleep period (indicated by a solid bar on the ASA score
bar in Fig. 1)
Sleep efficiency: percentage of the sleep period spent

sleep period] x 100)
Nights were not scored as usable data if the child was sick
or taking medications, the child slept with another person
for the entire night, the actigraph was off or not working for
all or part of the night, or  the diary indicated unusual exter-
nal motion, such as sleeping in a car or train. Table 1 shows

Data Analysis
We calculated the intraclass correlation estimating the
reliability of measures assessed on a single night of record-
ing within each age group for each measure, using param-
eters derived from a random effects analysis of variance on
all available data.30 By applying the Spearman-Brown
prophecy formula,30 we then were able to estimate the
effects that changes in the length of the test (number of
recorded nights) would have on reliability. Such reliability
coefficients indicate the proportion of true-score variance
in aggregated test scores, with coefficients above .70 indi-
cating adequate reliability according to criteria that have
been proposed for an individual difference measure.31
Missing data were left missing, and thus reliability esti-
mates may include some increased variability.
Additional analyses with data from adolescent groups
assessed the effects of night of the week on reliability of
measures, because adolescents are known to manifest dif-
ferent sleep patterns between weekday (or school) nights
and weekend nights.32-35 Reliability coefficients were cal-
culated within each adolescent group for 5-night mean val-
ues that included only 5 weeknights, and 5-night means
that included 3 weeknights and 2 weekend nights. In this
way we aimed to keep the size of the aggregate the same

RESULTS
Reliability estimates for aggregated values over suc-
cessive numbers of recording nights (1 to 7) for each mea-
sure and each group are presented in Tables 2 through 6.
Columns show reliability estimates for mean values based
on a given number of nights. As shown in the tables,
increasing aggregation was associated with greater reliabil-
ity (eg, 5-night mean values were more reliable than 4-
night mean values). Adequate reliability (≥70 indicated in
bold on the table), however, was infrequently reached for
most measures with fewer than 5 nights. For certain vari-
ables, even 7 nights of recording failed to provide this level
of reliability. Marked differences were clear among mea-
sures; adequate reliability was evident for sleep start (Table
2) for most groups with 3 nights of recording, but only five
of 10 groups had adequate reliability for sleep period
(Table 3) even with 7 nights of recording. Six or 7 nights
produced reliable estimates of sleep minutes (Table 4) in
most subject groups.  Wake minutes (Table 5) and sleep
efficiency (Table 6) estimates were adequate with 5 nights.
Reliability estimates were markedly low for 36-month-old
children on wake minutes and sleep efficiency, and none of
the adolescent samples showed adequate reliability for
sleep period. Examination of means, standard deviations,
and coefficients of variation indicated that restriction of
range was not a reason for low reliability values.

Table 7.—Reliability of measures aggregated over weeknights vs

SLEEP, Vol. 22, No. 1, 1999
Reliability estimates for 5-night mean values aggregat-
ed over weeknights only or over a combination of
weeknights and weekend nights are presented in Table 7.
Few meaningful differences were apparent between the
two sets of estimates, except for a loss of adequate reliabil-
ity for sleep start and sleep period during the fall session
(when students were going to school), when weeknights
and weekend nights were combined.
To evaluate the influence of type of recording night on
assessed stability over time, correlations between summer
and fall sessions for adolescent group B were computed for
mean actigraphy values aggregated over various combina-
tions and numbers of nights (see Table 8). The variables
sleep start, wake minutes, and sleep efficiency showed sig-
nificant stability over the 2-month interval for all combina-
tions of nights, indicating excellent stability over several
months for these measures. Sleep period and sleep minutes
were significantly correlated only when weekend nights
were included in the average.
DISCUSSION
Actigraphy has become a widely used methodology
because it appears at first glance to be easy, affordable, and
user-friendly. Our goal was to evaluate some of the psy-
chometric properties of this technique by scoring actigraph
records with algorithms validated for the specific device
used (Mini-Act actigraph) and for the kinds of participants
studied (children and adolescents). The first question we
addressed was how much acceptable data can be expected
from a 7-day recording period. Our experience with the
children and adolescents in these three studies indicates

Table 8.—Correlations between summer and fall session mean val-
ues aggregated over various combinations of nights (n= 14 to 26,
adolescent group B)
that a loss of up to 28% of weekly recordings may be
expected; the main reasons were illness, technical prob-
lems, and participant noncompliance (including failure to
wear the actigraph or complete the diary regularly and
accurately). Further, from 7-day recordings, 44% of partic-
ipants with acceptable data sets had fewer than 7 scorable
nights, with 93% yielding at least 5 nights (not necessarily
consecutive). Thus, from a practical point of view, studies
aiming to collect 5 nights of actigraph data should likely
record for at least a week.
The next question was how much night-to-night con-
sistency was evident for children and adolescents across
the age ranges studied. For all measures, estimates over 1
or 2 nights were poor. In contrast, reliability estimates for
mean values aggregated over any 5 nights of recording
were generally adequate for sleep start time, wake minutes,
and sleep efficiency. Measures of sleep minutes and sleep
period were less reliable, and may require 7 nights or more
to obtain adequate estimates of stable individual differ-
ences. Extrapolating from these data combined with the
data for the number of acceptable records, a recording time
of at least a week should be used to obtain commonly used
actigraph measures to reliably characterize individuals.
This suggestion is consistent with the data presented in
other studies that assessed stability across nights for other
devices and other scoring algorithms.24,36 Adequate relia-
bility is especially important for clinical applications,
where the unit of analysis is the individual and unreliable
data may result in incorrect diagnostic classification.23
The poor reliability estimates for sleep start time in the
adolescent group studied during the school year led to fur-
ther analyses. Reliability estimates of 5-night aggregates,
some including only weeknights and others including a
combination of weeknights and weekend nights, indicated
that sleep period stability was poor for adolescents exam-
ined during summer sessions (regardless of the mix of
nights) and for the weeknight/weekend night combination
for adolescents examined during the fall session. Sleep
start time reliability for the combined weeknight/weekend
night measure was also poor for the adolescents studied
during the fall. Together, these findings highlight the often-
noted instability of adolescent sleep scheduling.32-35
Nevertheless, we found significant and high correlations
between summer and fall session measures for all five acti-
graph variables when weekend nights were included. This
finding supports the usefulness of these measures as indi-
cators of stable individual differences in sleep-wake pat-
terning in adolescents if weekend nights are included in the
aggregated measures.
We do not understand why 36-month-old infants
showed such low reliability on wake minutes and sleep
efficiency. Simply put, individual 36-month old children
varied widely from night to night on both wake minutes
and sleep efficiency. We do not know whether this is a
10
SLEEP, Vol. 22, No. 1, 1999
characteristic of the children in our sample or a function of
a particular developmental instability at this age.
Because of the limitations of any sleep-scoring algo-
rithm, measurement error may not be equivalent across all
records. For example, measurement error for wake minutes
may be higher for records with large amounts of activity
than for records with small amounts of activity during
sleep. Reliability estimates may thus have some error as a
function of our sleep-scoring algorithm.
This study contributes to a relatively new literature,
assessing some ages of children with one specific instru-
ment and algorithm for estimating sleep. The generaliz-
ability of our conclusions will increase as more informa-
tion becomes available on the degree of similarity across
instruments and similarity of phenomena across age
groups and clinical populations.
From these three studies, we conclude that:
1.  Actigraphy is a methodology that requires care in its
implementation and yields reliable data for externally doc-
umented bedtime periods.
2.  Individual differences on some sleep parameters that we
expect to be reproducible (eg, sleep start, wake minutes,
and sleep efficiency) likely require aggregation over 5 or
more nights of usable recording. We suspect this is a func-
tion of intraindividual variability resulting from situation-
al and other influences that can affect any sleep/wake mea-
sure when sleep/wake schedule is not artificially con-
trolled, rather than error due to the recording methodology.
There is a wealth of prior evidence that sleep is influenced
by such factors as amount of prior sleep,37 presence of bed
partner,38-40 fixed or subject-selected scheduling,18-20,41 and
so forth.
3.  Individual differences in sleep period and sleep minutes
likely require more than 7 nights of recording. Again, we
suspect this reflects the joint contribution of both reliable
individual differences and situational factors. In fact, insta-
bility of sleep scheduling in teenagers is a subject of con-
siderable current interest.27,42,43
4.  The social context in which recordings are made may
influence the psychometric properties of the data obtained
(eg, summer vs school-year schedules for adolescents).
In sum, our findings support continued use of actigra-
phy for studies of child and adolescent sleep/wake pat-
terns, but only when appropriate attention is given to prag-
matic issues around the data collection and understanding
of the psychometric properties of shorter vs longer data
collection periods.
